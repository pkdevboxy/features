# Rule engine

_Note: this feature spec is a placeholder at the moment. It was introduced after the fact of developing the core software model's rule engine. It exists to capture designs for new work that improves the existing rule engine._

## Summary

TODO: What _is_ the rule engine? What are its boundaries? Which user roles interact with it? How do they interact with it?

## Motivation

TODO: Why did we build the rule engine in the first place? What problem(s) does it solve?

## Status

Like the rest of the software model, the rule engine is in an "incubating" state.

## Work

See the subdirectories here and the [`feature:rule-engine` label](https://huboard.com/gradle/langos#/?label=%5B%22feature%3Arule-engine%22%5D) in HuBoard.
