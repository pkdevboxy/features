# Dependency report for custom ecosystem

As a plugin author, I can integrate my custom model elements with Gradle dependency report features by implementing the correct interfaces and as a result, build users will be able to request dependency reports against models built out of my custom model elements.

## Test cases

[ ] Build user can request dependency report for custom binary
[ ] Build user can request dependency report for custom component
[ ] Build user can request dependency report for custom source-set
[ ] Build user can request dependency report for project and the report will include custom components along with their binaries
