# Project with Scala source-set can be imported into the IDE

## Tests

- Component and binaries level Scala source-sets are properly mapped
- Module/Project should have reasonable Scala source settings
- Eclipse: Scala natures and builders enabled
- IDEA


## Implementation notes

Take time to design how to support custom languages and then `Scala` and `Java` are just instances.
