# Build author can declare test suite dependencies

## Summary
As a build author, I can declare test suite dependencies so that build users can compile and execute tests successfully.

## Usage
Because there are a number of distinct ways build authors can declare test suite depenndencies, this story is broken down into the following sub-stories:

 - [x] [Build author can declare test suite source set dependency on external library](on-external-lib/scoped-to-source-set)
 - [x] [Build author can declare test suite-wide dependency on external library](on-external-lib/scoped-to-suite)
 - [ ] [Build author can declare test suite dependency on internal library](on-internal-lib)
