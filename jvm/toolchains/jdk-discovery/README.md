# Gradle discovers local JDK installations

Story: https://github.com/gradle/langos/issues/157

## Summary

This story will let a Gradle automatically discover local JDK installations, using conventional install locations. It is expected to reuse the same mechanism that are now used in test fixtures. This feature will allow the user to avoid declaring the list of installed JDKs if we can find them automatically.
