# Test suite can declare Java runtime platforms and executes against all

Story: https://github.com/gradle/langos/issues/155

## Summary

This story will let a build author declare the list of target runtime platforms for a test suite. A test execution task will be created for each target runtime platform. This will allow a user to test the behavior of an application on various JDKs, for example, using a single test suite definition.
